        <p class="BodyPara">I didn't know Matt, but I spent many hours getting to know Matt watching his teaching videos, Q&amp;A and tutorial live streams, HTM School and other work at Numenta. In an effort to closely examine a company and its technology I came to realise what a truly sincere, nice and giving person Matt was. He was a great educator.</p>
        <p class="BodyPara">He was a rare individual and set an example we could all follow. This app is in part a demonstration to students that in using the simplest of languages levels there is, complex and powerful abstractions can be built.</p>

        <h3 class="h3 BodyPara cSd"  id="htm-school">HTM School</h3>
        <p class="BodyPara">HTM School is a series of educational videos created by former Numenta Open Source Community Manager Matt Taylor (1978-2020). Watch these videos to see detailed visualizations of HTM systems running, and thoughtful breakdowns of the biological algorithms involved.</p>
        <p class="BodyPara">This series was designed for a general audience to be viewed in order, but feel free to jump into any episode. There is no need to have a background in neuroscience, mathematics, or computer science to understand HTM Theory. For those of you wanting more detailed resources on this subject, please have a look at Numentaâ€™s technical papers.</p>

        <p class="BodyPara">(<em>Shared by Christy Maver</em>)</p>
        <p class="BodyPara">At today's team meeting, several of us wore tie-dyed, brightly colored, or NuPIC shirts to honor Matt.  We shared stories and some of our favorite memories.  Much like when he was alive, there was a lot of laughter shared today.  He made an impact on all of us that will continue to live on.  Even some of the newer employees who never met him shared their impressions of him, or how they felt like they knew him from watching his videos.</p>
        <p class="BodyPara">It doesn't seem possible that it's been a year.  We miss you, Matt!</p>
