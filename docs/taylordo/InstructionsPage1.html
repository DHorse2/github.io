        <h2>Quick Start</h2>

        <h4>Status: InProgress</h4>
        <p>Install the product using default settings. You will need to specify what volume type your disks are; System, Development, Archive and Data are the available types. Mixed drives (or if you are unsure) should be typed as Development. No further action is required... once it's done.

        <h3>First Time Use</h3>
        <p>The first time you optimize (a Yearly) will run quietly for up to 50 hours without significantly impacting your performance while it runs. The time depends on several things such as the state of your drive and prior optimizations and your use of the system.</p>

        <h3>Optimization Scheduling (InProgress)</h3>
        <p>The task scheduler will replace Windows Defrag with TaylorDo taks for Yearly, Monthly, Weekly and Daily (mid week) optimization.</p>

        <p>The DoTaskOnDemand command will disable all schduled tasks until you issue a DoTasksOnSchedule command is issued. DoTaskReset will recreate the schedule should you need to. Finally, a DoTaskRestoreWindows would remove all entries and restore the standard Windows defragmentation.</p>

        <h3>Customizing Your Zones</h3>
        <h4>Prioritizing (ordering) your data:</h4>
        <p>Each volume is divided into up to 21 zones based upon the type or category of information contained therein. The first dozen are system releated and can generally be ignored. If you ever get data in Zone 21 please contact me; this is unassigned and a type of error.</p>
        <p>For the most part, statistically, you shouldn't need to change the order of these zones. However, the importance of these categories determines their order based on your systems and needs. Examining the report created by any run gives precise information on zone size and location on which to base these decisions.</p>
        <p>Here is the complete list for the Any Complex Volume script:</p>
