						desktop system / document management practices I had been using for IT
						technical and web clients.  Clearly a sensible additional goal would be
						to obtain some basic work to live and study.

						work in specialty woods, artistic wood products and beautifully unique
						timber-frame homes.

					The recent C# framework has been an enjoyable and productive effort.
					As part of the development process many different features and patterns
					within .Net have gotten some attention.  Though not the fast way to complete
					the project, it met all it's goals and was a great ride!
					It has moved forward but the original aim was research into conversion
					of multivalued applications to the .Net platform along with
					language virtualization and extension.
