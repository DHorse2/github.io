						  Outlook Folder Synchronization to Disk
      					</h3>
                          <p id="B1D1P1" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  There are a number of more obscure issues involved with Outlook.
						  Like many applications it uses one or more large database files for storage.
						
						  Thus a duplicate though often differnt
						  folder structure is create both on disk and in Outlook itself.
						  <br><br>
						  A second more widespread issue is that when searching the
						  system you must perform one search on disk and a separate search
						  using Outlook.
						  Our document management standard required certain types of documents
						  for specific folders to be present in the directory either as an original or a link.
						  </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P2" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  This outlook project allows the user to specify a root directory
						  on disk for each root directory in Outlook.
						  Any changes made to Outlooks folders is reflected in the underlying
						  disk folders.
						  </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P3" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  This raises the question of if a users wants all email and attachments
						  to be both searchable and accessible under Windows.
						  The alternative used here to indicate what email and documents should
						  be duplicated in the file system.
						  </p>
                          <h3 id="B1D1H2" class="BodyPara cSd CPT">

						  Expected Usage
        				  </h3>
                          <p id="B1D1P4" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  The first release of this add-on restricts itself to duplicating the
						  folder structure.
						  It is left to the user to do a save on email and attachements that
						  are important enough.
						  My own preference is to save it all automatically.
						  However that in turn requires being able to exclude any or each
						  folder(s) from save.
						  </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P5" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  My own internal policy requires shared and consistent directory structures.
						  Where they are indeed shared this would be ideal.
						  More often, there is a dual approach being used, and this is consistent in
						  systems, user software, and programs such as Outlook.
						  There is one very flat set of folders to oranize a company, area or subject.
						  There is also a comparatively deep folder structure that defines the area
						  hierarchically, organizationally and subjectively.
						  </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P6" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  Again for myself, this is dual structure is quite acceptable and even 
						  encouraged. However, I additionally include a requirement for adding
						  numerous links or shortcuts in order to allow navigation between the two easily.
						  Flat vs. hierarchical are both valid and very useful organizational styles
						  that should be employed dynamically and as needed.
						  This is similar to keeping an independent set of mirrowed Outlook folders somewhere
						  in the subject directory.  For example, in a folder called MailFolders.
						  </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P7" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
                          </p>
                  	<div id="B1D2" class="BodyParaRight CalloutBorder">
                          <p id="B1D2P1" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  I find the VBA environment to be quite useful.
						  The workflow related and custom
						  fields and features of Office and in this particular, Outlook are
						  fairly powerful.
                          </p>
                          <p id="B1D2P5" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  Customized forms seem an under utilized resource as well.
						  A case in point,
						  you will freqently see departments codifying data into form
						  text fields informally, where it is self-evident that a properly
						  defined field would be far more appropriate.
						  The simplest and most common example putting the correct keyword
						  in a reply subject line.

  						  The Project
  						  </h3>
                          <p id="B1D1P8" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
		  				  This was evaluative project and self-contained so there is no fee wanted for
						  this code just registration.
						  I would probably want to clean up the code before or with a client-user.  I am
						  definitely planning to use it myself.
                          </p>
                          <p id="B1D1P9" class="BodyPara aLeft CP">
						  Although there is lots of room for developing with VBA this project was just
						  part of larger volume of work in scripting technologies and time management.
						  With a goal towards document transparency you are ideally looking
						  to expose both the data and better still the application model.  I find the
						  combination of Windows (shell) and Office scripting fairly powerfull.
