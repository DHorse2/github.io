						I also had a need for some filler/student work while upgrading

						more than one goal within a single project.
						That is, to combine using the research on the current IT industry with
						desktop system / document management practices I had been using for IT
						technical and web clients.  Clearly a sensible additional goal would be
						to obtain some basic work to live and study.

                        During the mid ninties I decided reduce my IT practive to a part time effort
						and take the time to pursue other more rounded interests.  My favourite area
						was without a doubt specialized light landscaping.  Renovations and electrical
						were also both challenging, interesting and varied work.  Skills development and
						variety were only one part of it though.

					    Ten years of small town life was wonderful and the work allowed me to make

						I also have a great debt of gratitude to Michael Vaughan for the chance to
						act as his business consultant but even more so for the wonderful
						work in specialty woods, artistic wood products and beautifully unique
						timber-frame homes.

                        Resume writing is a good area to apply writing skills.
						For example, you are addressing a skilled and difficult audience.
						It employs sales and marketing skills requiring the author to be
						clear and concise.
						The IT resume here is unfortunately a good example of not being
						nearly clear and concise enough (a revision is in the works.)
                    </p>
                    <p id="D1P2" class="BodyPara">
						It might be folly to call resume creation creative writing here,
						yet that is precisely what it is.
						That statement will be accepted by many readers but likely be taken
						as a euphemism for creative distortion by others.
						The readership will include varied roles, levels of responsibility
						and size of organization.
                    </p>
                    <p id="D1P3" class="BodyPara">
                        An effective resume requires entegrity, accuracy and honesty.
						It includes the need to balance distracting and irrelevant detail
						from points of direct interest to the reader.
                    </p>
                    <p id="D1P4" class="BodyPara">
						With a diverse background the different targeted resumes shown
						here may seem to discuss different people or be written by different
						authors but that is not the case.  They are based solely on my
						own 30 year career.
                    </p>
                    <p id="D1P5" class="BodyPara">
						I have always felt resume writing has many of the same characteristics that
						bother me about statistics.
						Its all in the presentation...
						Nothing short of a face to face interview and at least a brief look at a
						person's work really gives minimally accurate idea their true abilities
						and personality.

                    <p id="D1P6" class="BodyPara">
					    In '08 I found myself in the uncomfortable position that my entire portfolio
						very much consisted of other compainies' proprietary software.
						Good bragging rights but not something you can actually show anyone...
						In addition, the prototypes and incomplete study projects I did have
						available were not very impressive in my own view.
						I decided that the main goals of my upgrading for C# and web enabling
						applications would have to include some significant work that I could
						distribute however I chose.

                    <p id="D1P7" class="BodyPara">
						As I add content to this site I will be including much of the work in the
						form of a portfolio.
						During this site construction phase please feel free
						to contact me if your needs are specialized enough to require one of the
						utilities that appear here.
						None are open source or in the form of downloadable installs at this time
