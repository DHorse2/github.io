What qualities I have to offer a prospective employer....

I am hard-working, creative, analytical, friendly and intelligent.  I am an excellent problem solver and troubleshooter.  I am able to quickly absorb your business goals, processes and important issues and keep my focus on your objectives.  I have a fast learning curve and am highly adaptable.

My approach to business involves a broad general knowledge in combination with being  specialist in my field.  I believe a team should be willing to do whatever is required based on your needs as a client.

I enjoy many service roles beyond design and development such as providing implementation, training, support and supervision. I work well independently.

Typically my business relationships last for many years because of a belief in loyalty, commitment and integrity.  I am not a salesman, estimator, nor an executive but am best suited to supporting the efforts of management, staff and my team.  Over 20 years of subcontract and consulting work has resulted in an exposure to many industries.

For small to medium sized businesses I can offer knowledge of accounting, business administration, analysis, evaluation and report writing, customer service, distribution and dispatch, and support for operations and marketing.  

For large organizations my skills in dealing with complex solutions have supported multi-company, multiple office, regulatory, tax, sales and demographic requirements including integrating diverse systems and technological needs.

In development I continue to adhere to platform independence and complete scalability.

Development is my passion and I am looking for a challenge in the latest technologies.  Any scale, any scope, I would like the opportunity to learn more about the needs of your organization.
